                ************************  READ CAREFULLY ************************
           --->  Polynomial Equations are Only Allowed To Be Entered in The Following Format  <---
           Enter Coefficient of Used Variable (Usually 'x') Followed Directly By the Power of That Variable Inside
           Parentheses\nFor Example:\n --->  5x^(2) - 7x^(1) + 3x^(Zero) Written as: 5(2) -7(1) 3(0)
           --->  x^(2) - x^(Zero) Written as: 1(2) -1(0)
           IMPORTANT NOTES:\n * First Example has 3 Terms While Second Example has 2 Terms and so on ... .
           * Spaces Between terms MUST Be Used. Example: 5(2)-7(1)3(Zero) Won't Be Recognised.
           * Order of Terms Doesn't Matter. Example: -7(1) 3(Zero) 5(2) is Allowed.
